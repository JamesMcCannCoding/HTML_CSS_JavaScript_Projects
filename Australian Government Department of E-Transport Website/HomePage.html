          <p>Tesla is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company. Tesla has earned a stout reputation over the past few 
            <br>years for their ground breaking designs and manufacturing of electric vehicles. Tesla cars are famous for being the first 
            <br>car to properly feature a <u>self driving system</u> that utilises satilite navigation to steer the car without driver input.</p>
            <br>
          <p><b><u>Tesla make a variety of E-car types such as:</u></b></p>  
          <ol>
            <p><b>Tesla Model S: </b>Is a luxury, high performance sports, <b>sedan</b> that can do 0-100km/h in just 1.9 seconds. This is made 
              <br>possible since the car boasts an impressive 1020HP. The model S is very efficient and gets <u>637km per charge.</u></p>
              <br>
            <p><b>Tesla Model 3: </b>Is more of an economical <b>sedan</b> that averages <u>576km per charge.</u> The model 3 is significantly 
              <br>cheaper than the model S but still has many of the luxury features as the sports sedan variant.</p>
              <br>
            <p><b>Tesla Model X: </b>Is a luxury, small cross-over <b>SUV</b>. The model X averages <u>536km per charge,</u> which is less than 
              <br>other tesla variations. This is due to its larger size and heavier weight.</p>
              <br>
            <p><b>Tesla Cyber Truck: </b>Is a luxury, high performance, off-road four-wheel drive truck. The truck has a range of <u>800km per</u>
              <br> charge, which makes it perfect for those long road trips.</p>
              <br>

            <p>LDV are a motor vehicle manufacturer that have been importing vehicles into Australia since 2014. 
              <br>LDV has diversified into additional commercial vehicles, work utes, passenger cars and family SUVs. 
              <br>Australia's first electric ute could be in local showrooms by the end of this year, courtesy of Chinese brand LDV. 
              <br>With an electric delivery van that may not be far behind it.</p>
              <br>
            <ol>
              <p><b>E-D90 Van:</b> The electric van's front wheels are driven by 150 kW electric motor, while there are up to three 
                <br>battery-pack choices <u>(51.5kWh, 72kWh and 88.55kWh)</u>, offering between <b>237km and 353km of range</b> -
                <br>According to the 'World harmonised Light vehicle Testing Procedure' <em>(WLTP)</em>, and is aided by an innovative

                <br>
              <p><b>E-T60 Ute:</b> The Australian distributor for the LDV T60 ute is understood to be well progressed with plans

                <br>maximum driving <b>range of 325km</b> and can tow up to <u>1,000 kg. </u>It is important to note that the electric 
                <br>driving range halves to about 160km when towing <u>1,000kg,</u> because of the extra weight.</p>

          <p>Volvo Trucks Australia has recently launched the all-electric medium duty truck range for Australian transport operators. 
            <br>The new Volvo FL and FE Electric medium duty range meet the demand from society and customers for dramatic cuts in CO2 emissions.</p>
            <br>
          <ol>
            <p><b>FL Electric:</b> The Volvo FL Electric is built to make everyday life run even smoother with a minimal CO₂ footprint. 
              <br>It acts like the city's red blood cells - bringing what's needed to the right place, at the right time. The FL features up 
              <br>to <u>135kW of power</u> with a range of up to <b>300km. </b>It's key selling point is it's ability to haul <b>16 tonnes</b> 
              <br>on pure electric motor.</p>
              <br>
            <p><b>FE Electric:</b> The Volvo FE Electric is larger than the FL as it has four entry points instead of two and a higher power motor 
              <br>of <u>225kW.</u> As a result of it's larger size, the FE has a reduced range of <b>200km</b> compared to the 300km that the FL offers. 
              <br>However, the FE has a much higher towing capacity of <b>23 Tonnes</b> compared to 16 Tonnes from the FL.</p>
              <br>
          </ol>
          <p>Hauling loads with an electric truck goes a long way to help the environment. Diesel trucks are one of the highest polluting vehicles on the road. 
            <br>If Australian companies are able to switch to electric trucks, it would cut emissions down massively. A big incentive is for companies to save 
            <br>cost on fuel costs and maintenance repairs. Contact Volvo to find out more here: <a href="https://www.volvo.com/en/">www.volvo.com.en</a>

          <p>
            The Australian Government Department of E-transport has commenced operations in <u><b>July 2022</u></b> with the rise in popularity in E-vehicles in Australia 
            <br>in recent years. So yes, we are pretty new to the scene! With the rise of electric vehicles in Australia, the Department of transport is experiencing more 
            <br>and more pressure to expand and create a sub department that specialises in EVs. 
            <br>
            <br>Don't worry, the Australian Government Department of E-transport isn't going anywhere! We plan to expand this website with more content and we always strive 
            <br>to improve user experience.

          <h3 id="Goals">What are our goals?</h3>
          <p>The Australian Government Department of E-transport has a primary goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 43% below 2005 levels by 2030.
            <br> 
            <br>Carbon emissions from petrol and diesel vehicles are among the leading causes for global warming. This is why Australians need to make the switch to electric 
            <br>vehicles in a timely manner. By choosing to drive an EV you are helping to reduce harmful air pollution from exhaust emissions. An EV has zero exhaust emissions, 
            <br>but still creates a degree of greenhouse gas emissions when it is charged from the electricity grid.
            <br>
            <br><b>Utilise renewable energy:</b> If you have a solar PV system and charge your EV during the day, you can reduce your greenhouse gas emissions even further. 
            <br>Another way is to purchase GreenPower from your electricity retailer. Then, even if you recharge your EV from the electricity grid, your electricity is coming 
            <br>from renewable energy sources.
            <br>
            <br><b>Improve the health of Australians:</b> Reduced harmful exhaust emissions is good news for our health. Better air quality will lead to less health problems 
            <br>and costs caused by air pollution3. EVs are also quieter than petrol/diesel cars, which means less noise pollution.
            <br>
            <br><b>Improve the health of Australians:</b> If EV charging is managed effectively, mainly outside peak electricity demand periods, it will help us to create a 
            <br>flatter electricity network demand profile over a typical 24-hour period. This will help us to:
              <ul>
                <li>Better utilise the electricity network.</li>
                <li>Help EV owners avoid higher-cost charging periods.</li>
                <li>Help the entire electricity system work more efficiently.</li>
                <li>Help support the integration of more small and large-scale renewable energy systems into the electricity grid.</li>
              </ul>
            <br>
            <br>On a national level, EVs can help with Australia’s liquid-fuel energy security. At present, Australia is highly dependent on other countries for petroleum imports. 
            <br>EVs are easy to power from local and renewable energy sources, reducing our dependence on foreign oil. EV’s will be unaffected if fuel supplies to Australia are 
            <br>ever disrupted or fuel costs increase significantly.
