        <h1>Report</h1>
        <p>
          <br>
          <h2><b><u>Why is this a good design?</u></b></h2>
          <br>
          <br>I believe the designs choices I have gone with on my website are good at presenting the site in a trustworthy and professional manner.
          <br> 
          <br><b><u>Colour: </u></b>All throughout the site I have gone with a classic plane white background as the primary colour. This design choice has many benefits 
          <br>such as keeping text clear and readable, creating a clean a professional look, allowing pictures to stand out easier, and all while keeping 
          <br>the site load times low. For the secondary colour, I have gone with a dark blue. The idea behind this is to give the site a calm appearance 
          <br>while creating contrast between the white background to make the banner standout without being too obvious. Another reason why blue is a good 
          <br>choice comes back to psychology and how when people think of electricity, they usually match it with the colour blue. This is a subconscious 
          <br>and involuntary thing people do and I think it works well with the site being about electric cars. 
          <br>
          <br><b><u>Text: </u></b>The font-family that I have gone with are popular and easy to read fonts such as Helvetica, Sans Serif and Arial. This is specified 
          <br>in my CSS document under global. I have kept fonts consistent across all pages to give the site a professional and uniformed look. All font is 
          <br>black if it is on a white background and white if it is on a coloured background. Font size is set to 16px to allow as much text as possible per 
          <br>section while also keeping it easy to read. I have incorporated a hover effect that when the user hovers over a link it changes colour and gets 
          <br>bolder. I have used this feature to make it easier for users to identify links. I have incorporated underline, italics, and bold highlights to 
          <br>some words in large bodies of text to help the key information standout to the reader. Page breaks are used to add white space in between lines 
          <br>of text to mark the end of a paragraph. 
          <br>
          <br><b><u>Imagery: </u></b>Images I have selected are of high resolution and minimal background noise. This is to make the focus of the image 
          <br>(such as a car or truck) to standout on the white background. This helps clarity and makes the presentation very professional. With the 
          <br>resolution, I tried to select pictures with around 1080p as this is the sweet spot for load times and image clarity. Any lower resolution 
          <br>and the images would have looked fuzzy and higher resolutions would look nicer but lead to longer load times for the page. If a page’s load 
          <br>time is too long (longer than 5 seconds) most people will lose interest and as a result close the tab.
          <br>
          <br><h2><b><u>How does this design conform to Web standards?</u></b></h2>
          <br>
          <br><b><u>Site layout: </u></b>With the design layout of the site, I have gone with web conventions by placing the logo in the top left corner, followed by title 
          <br>and then the navigation links in the right-hand corner. The logo is an anchor back to the home page. Other navigation links are of the major site pages. 
          <br>Links are large and clear with a blue highlight when hovered over to identify that it is a link. 
          <br>I have used a feature image with a ‘call to action’ to grab the reader’s attention. It is important that there is eye grabbing feature on the site that 
          <br>is eye-level with the reader as soon as they click and open the home page. This is to keep their attention for longer and encourage them to keep reading. 
          <br>
          <br>With images and text, I have kept all text to a left-align while having images to the right. This is primarily to make reading easier but also creates 
          <br>a clean and professional look. If images were placed anywhere without thought the page would look messy and it would be difficult for readers to follow the text.
          <br>
          <br>A footer has been added to the bottom of the page that includes the links: Home (for pages other than home), Contact, report, and back to top. The idea behind 
          <br>this is to make navigation easier for the user while following web conventions.
          <br>
          <br><b><u>Other features: </u></b>I have used a smooth scroll command in CSS to make scrolling look nicer for readers. 
          <br>I have set a margin down the page on both sides to help centre the page contents.
          <br>
          <br><h2><b><u>How this design conforms to Accessibility standards?</u></b></h2>
          <br>
          <br>Accessibility refers to providing accessibility for people who may have deficiencies involving sight, hearing, or other physical capabilities. 
          <br><u>The site attempts to follow accessibility requirements by:</u>
          <br>Ensuring clear and simple language. 
          <br>Compatibility with mobile users. I struggled with the design aspect to make it more compatible with mobile users. In some sections, 
          <br>the text and imagery have been misplaced due to padding and margin settings for desktop but have not been carried over to mobile. Unfortunately, 
          <br>I ran out of time to resolve these issues. All text and imagery are visible and clear enough for viewing mobile users but although some layout elements will need to be fixed.
          <br>
          <br>Using Style Sheet effectively to be compatible with google chrome.
          <br>
          <br>Tables have not been used for page layout.  
          <br>
          <br><h2><b><u>How will users find it easy to navigate on any device?</u></b></h2>
          <br>
          <br>Site navigation is very important when creating a website. The user needs to feel like they can easily navigate the page and figure out how to do so in just a few seconds 
          <br>after clicking on the page. Most people don’t have time to rely on scrolling alone to navigate and thus links are important to have to make navigation quicker.
          <br>
          <br>Users will find it easy to navigate my site since I have used anchor links that can take the reader to other pages or sections within the page. This is very useful for 
          <br>pages that are long, like my home page. Within my homepage I have a link in the footer that takes to reader back to the top of the page, without reloading the page. 
          <br>At the top of the home page, I have an anchor link that takes the reader straight to the information section about cars. At the top banner of every page, I have three 
          <br>quick links to the home page, contact page, and report page. In the footer of every page other than the home page I have a link back to the home page. 
          <br>
          <br><h2><b><u>Why should the department adopt my design?</u></b></h2>
          <br>
          <br>A government website needs to be highly accessible and usable since most of the population of Australia may need to use it at some point. Government websites are 
          <br>a good method to take the load off calls and appointments for government services. The ideal government website will be able to act as a portal and be equally 
          <br>as effective as a real person at helping the general public with their needs. Government websites are designed to reach the broader population and help as many 
          <br>people as possible; this includes people who may be impaired in some way. For example, government websites now have a read out loud feature for blind people. 
          <br>The text is read by a narrator where the reader can hear through their device speakers. Government website standards of accessibility also requires the website 
          <br>to be very fast and capable of being run on older devices that have less power. The website also needs to be able to run on all device operating systems and appear 
          <br>well on all screen sizes. 
          <br>
          <br>I believe the department should adopt my design since it is profession, fast, appears trustworthy, and has appealing styling. The department can use a lot of the 
          <br>ideas and styling characteristics that I used, and I believe that most people will enjoy using the site. However, I would not advise the department to adopt my 
          <br>website as it is now. My website needs to improve on accessibility for it to meet the standards of the government website criteria.  As mentioned before, my 
          <br>website needs to have aids for impaired people and also needs to be more compatible on other devices.
