          <h1>History</h1>
          <br>
          <p>
                Tesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. The company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. 
            <br>In February 2004, via a $6.5 million investment, Elon Musk became the largest shareholder of the company. He has served as CEO since 2008.
            <br>
            <br>In 2008 Tesla Motors released its first car, the completely electric Roadster. In company tests, it achieved 394 km on a single charge, a range unprecedented 
            <br>for a production electric car. Additional tests showed that its performance was comparable to that of many gasoline-powered sports cars: the Roadster could accelerate 
            <br>from 0 to 100km per hour in less than four seconds and could reach a top speed of 200 km per hour. The lightweight car body was made of carbon fibre. 
            <br>The Roadster produced no tailpipe emissions, as it did not use an internal-combustion engine. Tesla Motors found that the car attained efficiency ratings that were equivalent to 57 km per litre.
            <br>The vehicle’s electric motor was powered by lithium-ion cells—often used in laptop-computer batteries—that could be recharged from a standard electrical outlet. Despite a federal tax credit of 
            <br>$7,500 for purchasing an electric vehicle, the Roadster’s cost of $109,000 made it a luxury item.
            <br>
            <br>In late 2007 Eberhard resigned as CEO and president of technology and joined the advisory board of the company. It was announced in 2008 that he had left the company, though he remained a shareholder. 
            <br>Tarpenning, who was vice president of electrical engineering, supervising the development of electronic and software systems for the Roadster, also left the company in 2008. Musk took over as CEO. 
            <br>In 2010 Tesla’s initial public offering raised some $226 million.
            <br>
            <br>In 2012 Tesla stopped production of the Roadster to concentrate on its new Model S sedan, which was acclaimed by automotive critics for its performance and design. It came with three different battery 
            <br>options, which gave estimated ranges of 379 or 483 km. The battery option with the highest performance gave an acceleration of 0 to 100km per hour in slightly more than 
            <br>four seconds and a top speed of 209 km per hour. Unlike the Roadster, which carried its battery system at the back of the car, the Model S had its underneath the floor, which gave extra 
            <br>storage space in back and improved handling because of its low centre of gravity; this battery placement was used on later Tesla models. The Tesla Autopilot, a form of semiautonomous driving, was made 
            <br>available in 2014 on the Model S (and later on other models).
