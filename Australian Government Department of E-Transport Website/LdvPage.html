          <h1>History</h1>
          <br>
          <p>
                LDV Group Limited, formerly Leyland DAF Vans, was a British van manufacturer based in Washwood Heath, Birmingham. Historically part of Rover Group and Leyland DAF, 
            <br>it was later a wholly owned subsidiary of the Russian GAZ Group. Owing to the global recession and a lack of long-term investment, production was suspended at the 
            <br>LDV factory in December 2008. After a series of failed rescue attempts, the intellectual property rights were sold by administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers to Eco 
            <br>Concept in 2009, who sold them to SAIC Motor in 2010, with its Maxus subsidiary commencing production in China in March 2011.    
            <br>
            <br>LDV produced a range of panel vans, pick ups and minibuses, all available with various modifications and specifications. LDV's main customers were large British 
            <br>corporations, such as Royal Mail, National Grid plc and many other utility companies, which were politically persuaded to buy British built vehicles.

            <b><u>The Chinese LDV T60 electric ute has just gone on sale in New Zealand. Next stop: Australia. Here’s everything we know so far:</u></b>
            <br>
            <br>The first electric ute on sale in Australia is on track to be on local roads by the end of this year or from early 2023 – from an unlikely source.
            <br>Australian pricing for the LDV eT60 is yet to be announced. Early estimates pegged it at about $60,000, which is approximately $20,000 dearer than 
            <br>the equivalent diesel model.
