          <h1>History</h1>
          <br>
          <p>
                Vector E-bikes are manufactured in Western Ukraine. Although there has been some political unrest on the eastern border with Russia, Ukraine is 
            <br>a very large country, and Vectors are made near the western Polish border, in a very stable region. The man who started this is Artur Ragulskyi, 
            <br>he felt the other Ebikes like this did not have enough options for the customers, and he also felt there was plenty of room to find reasonable 
            <br>compromises that could lower the prices to a more affordable level. The most exciting feature of the Vector E-bikes is that the Kickstarter price for 
            <br>the most expensive complete model is under $6,000!
            <br>
            <br>Vector has over 20 team members in total. The company consists of three departments: development and design, manufacturing, marketing and sales. 
            <br>Main manufacturing facilities located in Ukraine and Romania. Main goal of the company to create fast and powerful electric bikes. 
            <br>We send Vector ebikes worldwide with logistics companies such as DB Schenker, DHL, DPD right to a client's door step. All shipping is insured.
            <br>In 2020, the company manufactured and sold over 100 e-bikes. In 2021 they reached 200 e-bikes and also launched a new model.
            <br> Vector co-operates with a range of large foreign companies and components manufacturers such as LG & Samsung. So their products are of high quality.
